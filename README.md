# Prework Study Guide 

## Description

This guide was created as a way to make note of new information learned while taking the coding boot camp. I wanted to build this project because I wanted to document all of the new things I learn as I go. Documenting these lessons will help me review and be a reference for when I run into issues.

So far, I have learned and practiced the basics of HTML, CSS and JavaScript as well as the Git commit/merge process.
