        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>HTML is used as the building block or foundation for web applications. It is like the frame of a house.</li>
          <li>Header: Information in the header is not visible to the viewer of the webpage (except for the title). The information in the header is to instruct the browser how to render the page.</li>
          <li>Body: Anything that should appear on the webpage needs to be in between the opening and closing tag of the Body.</li>
          <li>Sections: These are containers that help to separate different kinds of content on a page. You can have sections within sections.</li>
          <li>Every HTML element is essentially a box that has margins outside of the element (box) and padding inside the element around the conent inside contents.</li>

        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>CSS is used to add styling to an application.</li>
          <li>Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY) code helps keep codebases as compact as possible - reducing size and confusion.</li>
          <li>Using an HTML element's name as a selector and adding an attribute in the CSS file will apply those properties to all elements with that name.</li>
          <li>Using a class selector and attribute allows us to be selective about which elements have certain properties.</li>
          <li>Add the .class attribute to the CSS file first - then add the selector to the corresponding HTML element</li>
          <li>The class attribute defines what properties we want elements in the class to have.</li>
          <li> The class selector is what is added to the HTML elements that you want to have those attributes defined in the CSS file.</li>
